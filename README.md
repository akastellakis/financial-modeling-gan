# Analysis and Modeling of Financial Time Series

This Jupyter notebook is designed to provide insights into historical trends and forecast future movements in financial time series data. It employs data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling techniques to facilitate these analyses.

## Getting Started

To start using this notebook, you have two execution options: using Google Colab or running it locally.

### Execution in Google Colab

1. **Mount the Drive**:
   - If you're using Google Colab, you'll need to mount your Google Drive to access data and save your work. This can typically be done using the following code:

   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')

2. **Run the Notebook**:
- After mounting the drive, you can run the notebook by selecting Runtime -> Run all from the Google Colab toolbar. This will execute all cells in the notebook.

### Execution Locally 

1. **Install Dependencies**:

- Before running the notebook locally, you need to install the necessary Python packages. Look for the "pip install" cells in the notebook, run them once to install the required libraries, and then remove them from the code.

2. **Run the Notebook**:

- After installing dependencies, execute the notebook by selecting Runtime -> Run all. This will execute all cells in the notebook.

Feel free to explore and analyze financial time series data, make predictions, and fine-tune models using this self-explanatory notebook. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy analyzing!
